# Object-Detection-with-Trash-images

This project contains my work from my one month internship as a Data Scientist in Koncern IT at KÃ¸benhavns Kommune. During my internship I had the opportunity to participate in a Waste detection project, where I was exposed in the latest techniques in computer vision with python. I had the chance to learn and use libraries such as OpenCv and Pillow, how to do Data Augmentation and create Synthetic data.

---
In this project I have enlarged my dataset of images using different Augmentation techniques such as

- image sharpening
- flipping
- rotation
- perspective transformation
